        <h3 id="peek">ABOUT</h3>
        <p>The Volkswagen brand is one of the world’s largest and most important car manufacturers. For more than 70 years we have been making innovative technologies, top quality and attractive design accessible for many people – for example, with bestsellers such as the Beetle or the Golf. We want to proactively shape the ongoing transformation of the automotive industry: our growing I.D. family represents a new generation of fully-connected electric cars that will play a significant role in the breakthrough of this technology.

            With annual deliveries to customers topping the 6 million mark, the Volkswagen brand is a key pillar in the success of the Volkswagen Group. Wolfsburg is the brand’s nerve center – the city is not only home to brand headquarters and the development center, but also where the main plant is located. We operate over 50 production locations on all five continents and employ more than 200,000 people. With some 70 different models, we have a presence in all major market segments and almost every country around the world. Vehicle deliveries are highest in China and Europe.
            
            In 2016, we launched the transformation of the Volkswagen brand: With the TRANSFORM 2025+ strategy, the company has completely realigned itself. We have renewed our model range from the ground up. Volkswagen has made a clear commitment to e-drive vehicles. We are already on our way to CO₂-neutral mobility for all! With our enhanced “ACCELERATE” strategy, we are initiating the next phase of this transformation. Volkswagen will change from the ground up. The brand will stand for climate-friendly e-mobility like no other, for fascinating digital customer experiences, for new business models and for autonomous driving across the board. Over the past few years, we have built a strong starting point. With “ACCELERATE”, we are now giving the digitalization of the brand a further boost.</p>
